						<p class="bio">
							Andrew is a beginner programmer and web-developer attending the University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp. While he has taught himself some very basic C# and javascript, work and his busy schedule have always interfered with his ability to actually learn the subject matter. With his knowledge of that, he joined the boot camp to have a structured learning path to ensure his success as a Web Developer!

						<p class="bio">
							Andrew's favorite past times include attending music festivals such as EDC, Phoenix Lights and Decadence. He also loves to listen to music, DJ as a hobby, play video games and work out.
